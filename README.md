  <strong>Examining Inequality in Healthcare Utilization During Pandemic Disruptions in the United States</strong>
</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
  Health crises like the recent COVID-19 pandemic have continuously disrupted healthcare utilization, particularly among non-COVID-19 patients.
  However, it remains unclear whether these disruptions are experienced equally across populations or disproportionately impact specific
  sociodemographic groups, and how these inequalities evolve over the course of the disruption.
</p>
<p>
  In this study, we analyze electronic health records from millions of patients across the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic and show
  that, compared with the pre-pandemic period (2019), there was an around <strong>45% decline</strong> in the number of patient visits during the
  pandemic period (2020–2022). By employing the <strong>Gini coefficient</strong> to measure disparities in healthcare utilization declines across
  different sociodemographic groups, we identify a consistent increase in health inequalities during the pandemic, most pronounced across
  <strong>age</strong> and <strong>income</strong> groups.
</p>
<p>
  The decline in <strong>telehealth usage</strong>, which served as an alternative to in-person visits, after April 2021, was found to be associated
  with rising healthcare inequalities. These findings underscore that sustaining adaptive healthcare delivery strategies, such as telehealth, may
  help mitigate systemic inequities during long-term public health emergencies.
